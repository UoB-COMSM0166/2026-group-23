# A Roguelike RPG Game

Core Gameplay Loop 
### 1. 玩家拥有若干个初始球

The player starts each round with a certain number of balls.

球是玩家最核心的资源，用于驱动经济与成长，而非战斗。
Balls are the player’s core resource, used to drive economy and progression rather than combat.

### 2. 选择投放角度 / 时机，把球送入关卡

The player chooses the launch angle and timing to release the balls into the level.

投放本身是玩家唯一的直接操作，决定本回合的风险与收益。
The launch is the player’s primary interaction and determines the risk–reward outcome of the round.

### 3. 球经过不同区域

Balls travel through different zones within the level:

增加球数
Increase the number of balls

减少球数
Decrease the number of balls

转化金币
Convert balls into gold

触发特殊效果
Trigger special effects

这些区域共同构成关卡的“经济规则”，玩家需要在贪婪与稳定之间做选择。
These zones define the economic rules of the level, forcing players to choose between greed and safety.

### 4. 球全部结算为金币 / 状态（不攻击敌人）

All balls are resolved into gold and/or status effects (they do not attack enemies).

球在结算后消失，仅保留其带来的经济收益或长期影响。
After resolution, balls are removed, leaving only their economic rewards or persistent effects.

### 5. 敌人根据当前回合数 / 强度向玩家发起攻击

Enemies attack the player based on the current round and enemy strength.

战斗过程自动进行，结果取决于玩家此前的构筑与经济决策。
Combat is automated, and its outcome depends entirely on the player’s prior build and economic choices.

### 6. 用金币强化角色 / 球 / 规则

The player spends gold to upgrade the character, balls, or game rules.

升级方向包括生存能力、经济效率以及规则层面的永久强化。
Upgrades include survivability, economic efficiency, and permanent rule-based enhancements.

### 7. 进入下一关（敌人更狠，但“赚钱机会”也更疯狂）

Proceed to the next stage, where enemies are stronger but earning opportunities are greater.

风险与收益同步升级，推动玩家不断尝试更激进的策略。
Risk and reward escalate together, encouraging increasingly aggressive strategies.
