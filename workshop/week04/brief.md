In this group assignment of P5.JS frontend-only tower defense game, we sorted out the whole process of requirements around "no backend dependency, canvas rendering, and frontend interaction". The group was divided into roles such as P5.JS development, art, and testing, and each member wrote user stories from the claimed perspective. In the process, we deeply realized the characteristics of frontend-only requirements - all functions need to be implemented through P5.JS core APIs, and acceptance criteria need to quantify canvas coordinates, FPS and other exclusive indicators. Initially, our acceptance criteria did not consider P5.JS rendering efficiency. After cross-group communication, we added the requirement of stable 60 FPS, making the requirements more in line with actual development. When decomposing user stories, we split the tower placement function into P5.JS-specific tasks such as canvas initialization and event binding, clarified member division of labor, and avoided repeated development. This assignment made us understand that the requirement sorting of P5.JS projects needs to be closely combined with technical characteristics, taking into account both player experience and frontend feasibility, and group collaboration can complement perspectives, making requirements more comprehensive and executable.
